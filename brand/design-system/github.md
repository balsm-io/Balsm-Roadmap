### Updated in this project
- **Wordmark recolored again**: navy slate `#1F2D3D` (was pine green `#254B45`) — shares hue with the `.health` TLD (267°/268°) at two lightnesses. Updated in root + `care_app/colors_and_type.css` and README.
- Pulled updated `logo.svg/.png`, `logo-horizontal*`, `logo-vertical*`, `wordmark.svg/.png` — refreshed to match new wordmark color. Petal geometry itself unchanged.
- Refreshed `care_app/assets/logo-vertical.svg`.

### Diverges from upstream (needs a push)
- `brand/colors_and_type.css` — the neutral ink scale was retuned locally from warm olive-gray to cool navy siblings of the `#1F2D3D` wordmark (`ink-900 #2B2B25`→`#14202B`, `ink-600 #6B6B60`→`#526174`, `ink-50 #F6F6F2`→`#F5F6F8`, shadows `rgba(43,43,37)`→`rgba(20,32,43)`). The old olive scale was keyed to the retired pine/olive wordmark. Push this upstream so the repo and this project don't drift.

### Previously updated (2026-08-12 sync, wordmark recolor)
- **Vertical lockup** — redrawn pinwheel/overlapping-petal geometry (`logo-vertical.svg/.png` + `-mono-black/-mono-white/-on-white`).
- **Mono-lockup family** — `icon-mono-black/white`, `logo-horizontal-mono-black/white`, `-on-white` variants, `logo.svg/.png` alias — all present under `brand/`.
- **Wordmark TLD** — `--balsm-wordmark-tld #526174` (slate gray) in root + `care_app/colors_and_type.css` and README.
- **Reverse-lockup naming** — `logo-{vertical,horizontal}-white.png` renamed to `-mono-white.png` throughout (preview card, docs).
- Fonts and `--petal-*` tokens confirmed unchanged from `brand/colors_and_type.css`.

### Note
The `--petal-*` design tokens (aqua/emerald/blue/mint/violet — used across buttons, badges, charts) are intentionally UNCHANGED from the new logo artwork's bespoke 5-color palette. Worth confirming with the Balsm-Core team whether the two should eventually be reconciled.
